# Cloud-pipelines# Data Pipelines: From Scraping to Cloud Deployment 

## Overview

This project documents a transformative journey in the realm of data science, specifically focusing on a two-week Data Scientist Bootcamp with WBS Coding School in Germany. The immersive article captures the highs and lows encountered while navigating through the intricate landscape of data pipelines. The journey encompasses web scraping, API integration, data cleaning, database management, and concludes with cloud deployment using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive account of the challenges and successes experienced during the two-week Data Scientist Bootcamp. The focus is on learning and applying key data science concepts, from web scraping to cloud deployment.


##  Introduction to Web Scraping
The journey begins with an immersive dive into web scraping during the first week. The initial challenge involves extracting population data from Wikipedia articles about German cities. This phase includes:

Overcoming challenges in HTML and web development.
Creating a web scraper for automated data extraction.
Constructing a clean Pandas DataFrame for efficient data handling.

## Data Retrieval with APIs
Around day 3, the simplicity and efficiency of APIs are introduced as a contrast to the complexities of web scraping. Key activities during this phase include:

Creating Python code to interact with APIs like OpenWeatherMap and AeroDataBox.
Building functions for automatic data retrieval and manipulation.
Overcoming challenges in transferring data between MySQL and API responses
.
## Cloud Deployment with GCP
In the second week, the project transitions to the cloud, introducing a new set of challenges with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Activities in this phase involve:

Configuring SQL instances, secure connections, and cloud functions for serverless execution.
Debugging challenges and adapting code for the cloud environment.
Successful deployment of Python functions to Google Cloud Services.
## Conclusion
The project concludes with a sense of accomplishment as fully automated functions run in the cloud, marking the end of the intensive two-week segment. Reflection on challenges and lessons emphasizes the valuable skills acquired in web scraping, API integration, database management, and cloud deployment.
